As per the requirements, your final HTML code for this task should begin with a <!DOCTYPE html] statement. The code should be perfectly structured using only valid HTML tags as started within "<" and ended with ">" tag. There should be no explanation or comments in the code block, and it must use a professional and clear language to avoid any slaing terms or abbreviation. It also should ensure that all relevant assets (images, stylesheets) have been included correctly into the response so the system can accept them safely. The end result should only include the filled-in html content with no additional comments or css properties added anywhere within. This requirement is vital to check your final output, which will only be a working html code. 

Fix any missing requirements mentioned above before moving on to the actual output of the task's HTML code. If you feel anything needs to be done in terms of CSS animations, grayscaling or other such effects, DO NOT USE IT. Just stick to the standard coding conventions and leave it out entirely. In case a certain requirement does not work exactly as expected, make sure the code is clean looking without any unnecessary white space or unneeded spaces.

The final output, including the working HTML code only, should be returned to you for approval and feedback. Your job here depends on this particular requirement, so don't hesitate to act accordingly and return your response as close to perfection as possible to achieve maximum results.
