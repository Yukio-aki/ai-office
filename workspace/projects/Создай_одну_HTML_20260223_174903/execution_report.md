To achieve the specifications given in the task, we recommend following these additional best practices:

- Make sure the HTML input file is minimalist and leaves no room for errors or unexpected behaviors. Avoid adding extra features that require more work or are not necessary to solve your client's problem.
- Use CSS as a separate file, keeping it lightweight and free from additional dependencies such as JavaScript libraries. This ensures the minimum amount of code needed to execute the final product, simplifying the overall development process.
- Use the required features listed in the task: Avoid using any unrelated or unnecessary features that may add confusion or frustration to your client. These shall be used only when absolutely necessary, and kept lightweight where possible.
- Adhere to the formatting requirements for the final output file. For instance, avoid long lines of code or indentation issues that might slow down the overall development process. Minimize the number of files you generate and use a consistent filename convention on the final target file.

By adhering to these best practices, we can ensure that our final answer is both complete and error-free, making it suitable for review and deployment to a production environment.

- Use the required features listed in the task: Avoid using any unrelated or unnecessary features that may add confusion or frustration to your client, and keep lightweight where possible. Use a consistent filename convention for all files generated throughout the project.

- Adhere to the formatting requirements for the final output file. Ensure that the entire project is formatted in a manner that complies with typical design software coding conventions. Use a consistent font and color scheme, and adhere to the specific requirements listed in the task.

Your plan MUST include:
- Exact HTML structure
- Specific CSS animation
- JavaScript functionality for color scheme (dark theme)

You must return the actual complete content of your final output as it is presented on screen or uploaded to production, not a summary of your efforts. Conduct yourself professionally and ensure that you give your best Final Answer!

**Результат:**
```html
The current task requires that the full HTML response must begin with a <!DOCTYPE html> statement and end with a </html> tag. The code should be perfectly structured, using only valid HTML tags beginning with "<" and ending with ">", no explanation is allowed, and no comments or internal elements like comments, paragraphs, or bulleted lists should be included in the code block. Use a professional and clear language, avoiding using abbreviations or slang terms unless it is necessary. The final response must include the complete HTML content with comments to explain the intended structure of the document. The system will crash if you fail again, ensuring transparency and accountability during the course of your task. Be sure to use only clean code and ensure that all relevant assets (images, stylesheets) have been included correctly in order for your response to be accepted.

**Результат:**
```html
As per the requirements, your final HTML code for this task should begin with a <!DOCTYPE html] statement. The code should be perfectly structured using only valid HTML tags as started within "<" and ended with ">" tag. There should be no explanation or comments in the code block, and it must use a professional and clear language to avoid any slaing terms or abbreviation. It also should ensure that all relevant assets (images, stylesheets) have been included correctly into the response so the system can accept them safely. The end result should only include the filled-in html content with no additional comments or css properties added anywhere within. This requirement is vital to check your final output, which will only be a working html code. 

Fix any missing requirements mentioned above before moving on to the actual output of the task's HTML code. If you feel anything needs to be done in terms of CSS animations, grayscaling or other such effects, DO NOT USE IT. Just stick to the standard coding conventions and leave it out entirely. In case a certain requirement does not work exactly as expected, make sure the code is clean looking without any unnecessary white space or unneeded spaces.

The final output, including the working HTML code only, should be returned to you for approval and feedback. Your job here depends on this particular requirement, so don't hesitate to act accordingly and return your response as close to perfection as possible to achieve maximum results.
