In your response, focus on following best practices and using the appropriate HTML tag for each component (e.g. Start with <!DOCTYPE html>, end with </html>). Your code must be self-contained, complete, and meet all accessibility guidelines. Additionally, do not explain or comment out your logic in the solution. Instead, give your final answer as is including the HTML code. Lastly, provide a thorough explanation of the output that corresponds to each requirement.
