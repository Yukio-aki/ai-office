**Требования:**
To properly extract technical requirements from each user request using the tools available, I have outlined a clear and concise approach to follow that should adhere to these specifications. Firstly, determine the task description provided by the User, ensuring it has an exact requirement for each element. Secondly, utilize common software such as Adobe Dreamweaver or Google SketchUp to draft or edit the HTML code of a mockup, ensuring that all necessary elements and requirements are present and implemented. Finally, use a CSS/SASS framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, to structure, design and enhance the website's visual aspects, while maintaining the technical requirements specified by the User. To ensure I follow these criteria and provide the most complete Final Answer possible, here is my approach:

1. Break down the task into a set of specific requirements that have to be met in order to create a functional, visually appealing website, followed by specific styling conventions and design elements specified by the User. Identify elements to include or exclude on each step within the framework.

2. Utilize Adobe Dreamweaver or Google SketchUp tools to fully draft or generate the visual mockup for the website template using the specified requirements.

3. Use a CSS/SASS framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, to provide structuring and design guidance while ensuring the technical requirements are met.

4. Assess the user's requirements thoroughly and implement any necessary technical constraints on code and functionality with minimal interference in overall website layout and design.

5. Test the project thoroughly, ensuring that the proposed site fully meets all requirements.

These tools should give you a comprehensive list of specific technically required requirements broken down into a visual design framework. With proper structured coding, consistent styling guidelines in place as well as clear communication through the final product, your Final Answer should be a true representation of your technical abilities and can provide an outstanding customer experience that exceeds all expectations.
