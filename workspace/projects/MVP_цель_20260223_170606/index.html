Current Task: 
             REVISE this CSS code:

            1. Open up your main CSS file in your text editor (e.g. Notepad++, Sublime Text)
            2. To begin, go to the end of the `<style>` section, add the following lines: "/* Begin Styling */" and "/* End Styling */"
            3. Now, open up a new section at the beginning of your CSS file under the header elements, say it as "div > header" and type in the following code inside that section: ".header__section { box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; padding: 40px 30px; justify-content: center; align-items: center; position: relative; } .header__image img { width: auto; height: auto; max-width: 55px; } .header__image img[alt]:after { content:"\e66c"; font-size:48px; color:#757575; position: absolute; top:50%; transform: translateY(-50%); left:1em; z-index: -1; } .header__image img:hover [alt]:after { z-index: 2; opacity: 0.9; } .header__nav { width:25%; padding:20px; position:relative; text-align:center;} .header__sub-nav { margin-left:auto; margin-right:7%;}  
            4. Next, add the following lines of code in one block inside this "<div style="">" block: '.header__section { ...etc.} and ".sidebar, .main__content{ ...}"
            5. Open up a new section at the beginning of your CSS file under any header elements, say it as "div > header:first-of-type", type in the following code inside that section: ":hover { background-color:#117fff; } "
            6. Add the code for your main website's homepage or page title here if you have one: ".home__wrapper h1{ margin-top:10px; } .home__sub-nav{ margin-left:2%; padding:15px 30px; position:relative;} "
            7. Add the following lines at the very end, after closing of your HTML document in Notepad++ or Atom Text Editor (e.g. Dashboard > Source > Save): "/* Begin Styling */" and "/* End Styling */"
            8. Now click on F5 or Command+F5 to update the code to reflect whatever changes you've made thus far in your CSS file. 
            9. Make sure all text, images, video links, style, media queries, etc. that make up any page are now properly formatted and commented for future maintenance. The finished product will look better with proper formatting.
