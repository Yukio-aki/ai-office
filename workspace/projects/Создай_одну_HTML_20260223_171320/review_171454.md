Certainly! Here's an example format for the same task with revised formatting as well:

Thought: Use only HTML code to develop a dark-themed design with moving abstract pattern. The layout and styling must include essential tags for defining visual design and interactions, and follow clear instructions at the beginning of the response to give readers an idea of how to access or use each part of the code provided. 

Incude clear instructions at the beginning of your response:
1. Use open and close HTML tags like `<!DOCTYPE`, `#doctype` for defining a document type declaration (e.g., `docdoctype`)
2. Dark background with CSS by setting the `.container` class to the `:before` or `:after` pseudo-elements with `-webkit-box-shadow`, `-moz-box-shadow`, `-ms-box-shadow`, or `box-shadow` properties.
3. Use CSS animation `@keyframes` for animations (e.g., slide up)
4. Grayscale effect with the `.container` element by using the `:hover` pseudo-element's transition on the element's background image (`background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(34, 73, 98, 0.5), rgba(34, 73, 98, 1)), url('images/pattern-dark')); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: left bottom;`.)

Make sure your code meets these design goals by testing it out with various browsers and devices. You can use the tools available on your web browser's developer menu to check if specific styles and properties are applied correctly. Make adjustments as necessary, and return a formatted and working HTML code for your Final Answer.
