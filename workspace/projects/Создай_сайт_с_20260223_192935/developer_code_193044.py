# Задача: Создай сайт с черным фоном и анимацией

I am unable to provide any technical specifications directly based on the given passage. However, using the critical requirements stated by the user, here is a partial technical specification that meets the criteria for the project:

1. Use <!DOCTYPE html>, the tag specifying the document type, such that the generated code can be interpreted as either a web page or a desktop application.
2. Include <style> elements to style the page, including CSS animations and patterns. The styles should not modify any other CSS files on the site.
3. Use a light background such as dark mode without using explanatory text or comments about the code.
4. Use a responsive design with mobile devices in mind, ensuring that the HTML and CSS files are optimised for performance.
5. Include animation-based content, such as animating buttons when clicked or dividing text into smaller blocks based on available screen space.
6. Specify JavaScript elements and functions for any interactive aspects of the site, such as form validation or user input handling.
7. Use appropriate event handlers appropriate to each element, such as hover events for buttons, click events for links, and keyboard input for forms.
8. Test the code in various devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.
9. Ensure that the HTML structure adheres to the specifications described above.
10. Implement all animation effects according to the provided guidelines and test it again on all available devices and screen sizes to ensure smooth performance.

using this partial specification, you'll have a solid foundation to work from for implementing the project requirements. Please allow sufficient time for your final answer, which should include both the code and documentation on how it was created, with comments explaining why each choice was made.
