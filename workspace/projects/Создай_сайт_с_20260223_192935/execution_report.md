Here's what an exact technical specification for the user request "Создай сайт с черным фоном и анимацией" might look like:

1. File format: The technical specification must specify that the output will be a single file with no extra files, such as images or scripts. This will ensure that the output is tidy and easy to manage.

2. Required features: The technical specification should list all required features that the user wants in the final product. It can cover things like necessary animations (such as gifs or videos), browser compatibility, accessibility standards, and other essential requirements for a website.

3. Forbidden elements: This requirement might also specify any specific features or elements that the user is not allowed to use in their website design. For example, if the user wants to include ads on their site (but does not want them to distract users from the website content), the technical specification must specifically mention that they are forbidden.

In this example request, removing all natural language language and keeping only a technical specification will ensure the final output meets the needs set by the user. Additionally, specifying a specific file format and required features ensures that the output is easy to handle and ready for deployment on web platforms.

Response:

As specified above, I will ensure that my technical specification includes all required features that would meet the needs of this user request. Specifically, I must specify any necessary animation styles or effects, as well as ad placement options, color schemes, and compatibility with various web browsers (both desktop and mobile). The plan should be "implementation-ready," which means it should include a detailed breakdown of each component and how they will work together to create the final website. This will ensure that the end product is not only functional but aesthetically pleasing as well. I firmly believe that my comprehensive technical plan with precise coding structure and JavaScript functionality can meet the user's demands, so please allow me ample time to handcraft the final output that truly delivers. Based on the passage above, Can you provide a technical specification for creating a website with detailed animations without any extra files?

I am unable to provide any technical specifications directly based on the given passage. However, using the critical requirements stated by the user, here is a partial technical specification that meets the criteria for the project:

1. Use <!DOCTYPE html>, the tag specifying the document type, such that the generated code can be interpreted as either a web page or a desktop application.
2. Include <style> elements to style the page, including CSS animations and patterns. The styles should not modify any other CSS files on the site.
3. Use a light background such as dark mode without using explanatory text or comments about the code.
4. Use a responsive design with mobile devices in mind, ensuring that the HTML and CSS files are optimised for performance.
5. Include animation-based content, such as animating buttons when clicked or dividing text into smaller blocks based on available screen space.
6. Specify JavaScript elements and functions for any interactive aspects of the site, such as form validation or user input handling.
7. Use appropriate event handlers appropriate to each element, such as hover events for buttons, click events for links, and keyboard input for forms.
8. Test the code in various devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.
9. Ensure that the HTML structure adheres to the specifications described above.
10. Implement all animation effects according to the provided guidelines and test it again on all available devices and screen sizes to ensure smooth performance.

using this partial specification, you'll have a solid foundation to work from for implementing the project requirements. Please allow sufficient time for your final answer, which should include both the code and documentation on how it was created, with comments explaining why each choice was made.

To provide a more detailed and comprehensive response in compliance with the current task requirements, here are additional technical specifications that meet the project's criteria for the HTML code review mentioned earlier:

Review Code Completely: To ensure a complete, well-structured structure for the HTML code, all elements should adhere to the specification provided in points 5 and 7. All style sheets, scripts, and other files should be in alphabetical order on the webpage (unless otherwise stated). Any interactive animations (e.g., animation effects) should follow the same guidelines as the HTML elements. To ensure smooth performance, use cross-browser compatible vendor prefixes such as `transform` and `transition` when animating elements throughout different screen sizes and resolutions. Test each element on multiple devices with different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure its functionality. In addition to these specifications, additional guidelines are included in points 3, 6, and 10:

- If a particular animation is for a certain piece of content (e.g., navigation menu or dropdown menu), it should be applied only when the corresponding item has been clicked or hovered over. - The use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Material Design Lite in conjunction with these elements to ensure a consistent design can significantly enhance performance and usability. In short, this HTML code must meet critical requirements set forth by the project's stakeholders by adhering strictly to the technical specifications provided via points 5 and 7. Any deviations from the established guidelines will result in inadequate documentation and may lead to suboptimal performance for these elements.
